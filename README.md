# SudokuApplication

### This is just a small WPF application for playing Sudoku. I built it for an OOP course in my University.
### It has the following functionalities:
- Generating different sudoku puzzles.
- Four difficulties of the generated sudoku puzzles.
- Restarting the generated sudoku puzzle.
- Undo and Redo functionality.
- Timer.
- Hint.
- Solving the sudoku puzzle.
- Solving the sudoku puzzle automatically by the app.
- Showing the current progress.

### This is my first experience with WPF, so the app has a few bugs.
